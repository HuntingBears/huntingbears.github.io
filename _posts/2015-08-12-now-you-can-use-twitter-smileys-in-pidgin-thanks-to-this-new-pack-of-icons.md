title: Now you can use twitter smileys in pidgin thanks to this new pack of icons
---

Late last year, the people of Twitter decided to [share](https://blog.twitter.com/2014/open-sourcing-twitter-emoji-for-everyone) the sources of their popular smileys (or emojis) in SVG format. By using a [base project](https://github.com/stv0g/unicode-emoji) of unicode pidgin icons and the [original sources of twitter emojis](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji), I was able to put together a set of icons to use in pidgin with the visual appearance of the ones used in the official twitter page.

It is very easy to install. [Download the pack of icons](https://github.com/LuisAlejandro/pidgin-twemoji/archive/master.zip), unzip the file and place the `twemoji` folder under `~.purple/smileys`. Restart your pidgin and select the new icon theme on the menu `Tools > Preferences > Themes > Smiley theme`, as shown in the figure below.

Of course, the pack is free software and can be used and shared under the Creative Commons license [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

Its source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/LuisAlejandro/pidgin-twemoji) and [Gnome Look](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Twitter+Unicode+Emojis+for+Pidgin?content=170905).
